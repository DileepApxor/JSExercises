//here i have used a function called setInterval() which can do its task repeatedly till the clearInterval() function called 
//by using the setInterval() function, the timer runs upto the limit we set(1 minute here) then after counting 60 seconds it will 
//go to the stopTimer() function then the timer will be stopped as I used clearInterval for the the variable 'timerId' i assigned
//for the setInterval() function. In the setInterval function we will write a function to perform the repeated operations and 
//time(1000 milliseconds here), it performs the all operations with 1 second delay.
