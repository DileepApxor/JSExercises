// Comment below what did you understand from the previous 3 exercises about
// - prototype
// - __proto__


//In the last 3 exercises, i came to know the Leave class creation which contains some attributes like EmployeeName, startDate and endDate
//in a prototype object it contains all of the methods and functions mentioned in a class 

//By extending the Leave class into vacationLeave, sickLeave and maternityLeave allows us to inherit the properties and we can add other 
//specific properties to the base class to behave according to the name of the class(reasons)

//In javaScript we can split the classes we created using extend keyword and we can access all the class, methods and functions by using import and 
//export keywords.

//prototype is an object in JavaScript that is linked with every function and is used for inheritance and shared properties 
//or methods among instances created from that function, by adding properties or methods to the prototype of a function, 
//they become accessible to all instances of that function.


//__proto__ is a property available on all JavaScript objects, including functions and instances. 
//It refers to the prototype object of the current object. It is used to access the prototype of an object, 
//which is the object from which it inherits properties and methods.
